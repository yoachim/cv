I am writing to apply for your tenure track faculty position advertised in the AAS job register.  I received my Ph.D. in Astrophysics from the University of Washington Astronomy Department in 2007, was the Harlen J. Smith Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Texas, and am currently an LSST Science Fellow at the University of Washington. 

As a member of the LSST collaboration, I'm excited to see that Dearborn has access to the Magellan telescopes which would be ideal for spectroscopic follow-up of transient objects.  I'm also eager to apply to Dearborn because I have had great success the last few years mentoring undergraduate research projects and would be happy to continue at an undergraduate focused institution.


I'll be at the AAS meeting in Long Beach in January and would be happy to chat other times as well.


Sincerely,\\
